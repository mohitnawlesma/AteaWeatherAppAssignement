# AteaWeatherAppAssignment
Must use:
• ASP.NET CORE MVC (6)
• C#
• JavaScript or Typescript (preferred)
• React (preferred)
• SQL.
Achieve:
 Using any public weather API receive data (country, city, temperature) from 2 cities in 2-3
countries - with periodical update 1/min.
 Store this data in the database and show in graphs: Min and Max temperature
(Country\City\Temperature\Last update time).


Notes:
1. CityData.json contains city for which data is pulled from weather api and stored in db
2. WeatherApp.DataFetcher Is a console app which will pull data from weather app and store in db. It can be configured as Azure function or a scheduled Task.
3. Was not able to code the react part as I have not worked in react before
